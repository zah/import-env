Create a test suite.
It should check that the command works as expected in all supported shells.
Make sure to handle cases such as:
  - No changes to the env (check that everything stays the same)
  - Added ENV vars
  - Modified ENV vars (e.g. PATH)
  - Deleted ENV vars

The test suite should be executed with `just test`. Add a `Justfile` at the
root of the repo.

Create a GitHub CI action config for running the test suite on Ubuntu and macOS.
